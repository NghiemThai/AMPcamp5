    "##Running Standalone Spark Programs\n",
    "Because of time constraints, in this tutorial we focus on ad-hoc style analytics using the Spark shell. However, for many tasks, it makes more sense to write a standalone Spark program. We will return to this in the section on Spark Streaming below, where you will actually write a standalone Spark Streaming job. We aren’t going to cover how to structure, build, and run standalone Spark jobs here, but before we move on, we list here a few resources about standalone Spark jobs for you to come back and explore later.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, on the AMI for this tutorial we have included “template” projects for Scala and Java standalone programs for both Spark and Spark streaming. The Spark ones can be found in the /root/scala-app-template and /root/java-app-template directories (we will discuss the Streaming ones later). Feel free to browse through the contents of those directories. You can also find examples of building and running Spark standalone jobs in [Java](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html#a-standalone-job-in-java) and in Scala as part of the Spark Quick Start Guide. For even more details, see Matei Zaharia’s [slides](http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/matei-zaharia-part-2-amp-camp-2012-standalone-programs.pdf) and [talk video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k4yDKBYOcw&t=59m37s) about Standalone Spark jobs at the [first AMP Camp](http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/amp-camp-one-berkeley-2012/)."
