    "Memory is the key to fast Big Data processing. This has been realized by many, and frameworks such as Spark already leverage memory performance. As data sets continue to grow, storage is increasingly becoming a critical bottleneck in many workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this need, we have developed Tachyon, a memory centric fault-tolerant distributed file system, which enables reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce. The result of over two years of research, Tachyon achieves memory-speed and fault-tolerance by using memory aggressively and leveraging lineage information. Tachyon caches working set files in memory, and enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Thus, Tachyon avoids going to disk to load datasets that are frequently read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tachyon is Hadoop compatible. Existing Spark and MapReduce programs can run on top of it without any code changes. Tachyon is the default off-heap option in Spark, which means that RDDs can automatically be stored inside Tachyon to make Spark more resilient and avoid GC overheads. The project is open source and is already deployed at multiple companies. In addition, Tachyon has more than [50 contributors](https://github.com/amplab/tachyon/graphs/contributors) from over 20 institutions, including Yahoo, Intel, Redhat, and Pivotal. The project is the storage layer of the [Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS)](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/) and also part of the Fedora distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we first go over basic operations of Tachyon, and then run a Spark program on top of it. For more information, please visit Tachyon’s website or Github repository. We also host regular meetups in the bay area.\n",
